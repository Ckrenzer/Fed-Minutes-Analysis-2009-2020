```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                      results = "hide",
                      error = F,
                      warning = F,
                      message = F)
```

## Packages


```{r, echo = TRUE}
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidytext, dplyr, readtext)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
